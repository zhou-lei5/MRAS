# MRAS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MRAS (Master Regulator analysis of Alternative Splicing) is designed to
identify the critical splicing factors whose altered expression drives
the extensive splicing abnormalities, particularly in the biological
scenario of lacking spliceosomal mutations or other known manipulations
causing splicing disorders.

## The Overview of MRAS

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Overview of MRAS</figcaption>
</figure>

## Installation and Library

You can install the development version of MRAS from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zhou-lei5/MRAS")
library(MRAS)
```

## Usage and Examples

The easiest way to use MRAS: directly use the function `MRAS()`. The
specific parameters are detailed in `??MRAS` or `help(MRAS)`.

In summary, MRAS provides users with multiple input options to
facilitate the analysis of alternative splicing regulation. Users can
choose between the following options:

1)  Direct input of the set of alternative splicing events: Users can
    provide a set of differential splicing events and map them onto the
    pre-constructed regulatory network generated by MRAS. This allows
    the identification of key RBPs involved in the regulation of these
    specific splicing events.

2)  Construct a network using the user’s own data: If the sample size is
    sufficient, users have the option of constructing their own
    regulatory network using their own data. MRAS can use this
    user-provided data to infer the relationships between RBPs and
    splicing events, providing a customized analysis based on the
    specific experimental conditions.

By providing these multiple input options, MRAS allows users to explore
alternative splicing regulations from different perspectives, allowing
for flexibility and customization in the analysis process.

(The event coordinates in the networks and relationships inferred by
MRAS used the GRCh37 (hg19) coordinates.)

There are some basic descriptions which shows you how to use MRAS:

### The basic code of input type 1

Input type 1: Direct input of the set of alternative splicing events.

Firstly, you need to download the pre-constructed regulation network
generated by MRAS.In general, you will get two matrix:
“rbp_event_deal_all_total” and “rbp_event_deal_all”.

``` r
MRAS(input_type = "1",
     expr,psi,
     rbp_interested,
     m,n,
     rbp_event_deal_all_total,rbp_event_deal_all,
     result_type,threads,path_use)
```

### The basic code of input type 2

Input type 2: Construct a network using the user’s own data.

Here, we have prepared some test data for users to better understand the
usage of MRAS. Test data is included in MRAS and you can import it using
data(), which contains the RBP expression matrix as well as the event
PSI matrix.

#### BULK RNA-seq

Use MRAS in bulk rna-seq data:

### Type of MRAS result

After running `MRAS()`, there are three ways to display the results. In
addition to setting the form directly in the parameters, users can also
obtain other result display forms through the functions `get_Top10()`,
`get_tab_all()`, and `get_tab_simple()`. This allows users to access
additional result display formats without having to rerun `MRAS()`.

``` r
result_Top10<-get_Top10(path_use = "./tests/")
result_tab_simple<-get_tab_simple(path_use = "./tests/")
result_tab_all<-get_tab_all(path_use = "./tests/")
head(result_tab_simple[1:5,])
#>        RBP         D     NES1     NES2     odds MRAS_Score

### Interacting RBPs and co-regulated splicing events

``` r

## Tools: AS Events ID Converter

MRAS provides an ID converter specifically designed for splice events.
This converter facilitates the matching of splice event coordinates
obtained from different software, allowing seamless integration with the
pre-constructed regulatory network generated by MRAS. This functionality
simplifies the process of mapping splice events to the existing
regulatory network, increasing the usability and versatility of MRAS.

AS Events ID Format:
`Gene Symbol_AS Type_Chromosome_Chain_AS Events Coordinates`

<figure>
<img src="png/ID_format.png" alt="AS Events ID format" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">AS Events ID format</figcaption>
</figure>

MRAS provides the following functions for ID conversion of splice
events:

### `id_find()`

This function allows the user to input the output path of commonly used
splicing event identification software such as rMATS, SUPPA, and JUM.
MRAS will directly return the PSI matrix or canonical splice event ID
associated with the input data. This allows for seamless integration
into the MRAS pre-built regulatory network.

### `id_normalization()`

This function guides the user step-by-step through the input of the
corresponding column coordinates, allowing for the standardized output
of splicing event IDs. The process ensures consistency and compatibility
in the representation of splicing events.

### `id_change()`

This function converts splicing event IDs recognized by two different
splicing event identification software. By default, a mismatch
coordinate difference of 2bp is used to account for potential
differences in coordinate systems between the software. This allows
users to bridge the gap between different software outputs and harmonize
the representation of splicing events.

If you want to know more details, you can get help by `??MRAS::FUN` or
`help("FUN")`.

# MRAS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MRAS is designed to identify crucial RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) responsible for splicing variations in diverse scenarios, including cancer vs. normal, primary vs. recurrence, and more, not just in bulk data but also in single-cell data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MRAS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zhou-lei5/MRAS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MRAS)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r data_expr}
## "expr" is RBP expression matrix.
data("expr")
expr[1:5,1:5]
```
```{r data_psi}
## "psi" is events psi matrix."expr" and "psi" should have same column names.
data("psi")
psi[1:5,1:5]
```
```{r MRAS}
## Users can utilize the MRAS function for a streamlined analysis, or execute individual steps separately if they prefer to have more control over specific aspects of the analysis.
a<-MRAS(
  expr,
  psi,
  rbp_interested = "ESRP1",
  m = 22,
  n = 22,
  DS_pvalue = 0.05,
  DS_dPSI = 0.1,
  method =  "spearman",
  num1 = 0.2,
  num2 = 10,
  dpsi_network_threshold = 0.1,
  Regulate_threshold = 0.5,
  threads = 6,
  path_use="./tests/",
  result_type = "Top10"
)
```
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

# ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
# ```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
